Variables

```{r}
a = "Pencil"
a
```

```{r}
a = 21
a
```
```{r}
complex = 1 + 2i
complex
```

```{r}
Boolean = TRUE
Boolean
```


```{r}
class(a)
class(complex)
class(Boolean)
```

Operators in R

1. Assignment Operator

```{r}
1 -> a
a
b = 3
b
c <- 4
c
```
Use of these is the programmers preference there is no difference in the functionality.

2. Arithmetic Operators

```{r}
n1 = 10
n2 = 3


n1 + n2 
n1 - n2
n1 * n2
n1 / n2
```
Dont try to divide by zero if so, that will be stored as Inf

3. Relational Operators

```{r}
n1 > n2
n1 < n2
n1 == n2
n1 != n2
#### n1 === n2 This is not present in R which usually checks both value and type or class of the variable
```

4. Logical Operators

```{r}
a = TRUE
b = FALSE

a & b
a | b
!a

```

Data Structures in R

1. Vectors

```{r}
# Vectors can store only one type of Variables


```
